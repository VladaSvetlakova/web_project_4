#**NOTE TO REVIEWER**
 This is my last attempt and I hope I am able to pass. I am dissapointed that I had to use 3 attemps so far, due to the fact that there are alwyas NEW errors brought up, even though I corrected everything that was previously a critical mistake. I went over the 3 reviewes and corrected every single critical mistake that is needed to pass. As for .profile__name and .profile__subtitle, Liza said to use width:100% on the parent element of .profile__info, which is what I did and I used other suggested styles.I made it look like the example she gave me. She also said that the edit button does not have to wrap to the 2nd line becuase we do not have that in Figma. In general there is no Figma for the text-overflow of this part so I didn't know how it is supposed to look like, so it is strange we would get penalized for this part when it is not in the spec.
