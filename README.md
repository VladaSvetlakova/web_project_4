#**NOTE TO REVIEWER**
 This is my last attempt and I hope I am able to pass. I am dissapointed that I had to use 3 attemps so far, due to the fact that there are alwyas NEW errors brought up, even though I corrected everything that was previously a critical mistake. As for            .profile__name and .profile__subtitle, Liza said to use width:100% on the parent element of .profile__info, which is what I did and I hope it is correct this time.  There is no Figma for the text-overflow of this part so I don't know how it is supposed to look like. In the screenshot you provided in the most recent review  ( https://ibb.co/gVG61R9) it does not look to be breaking the layout to me, so I do not know why it is not correct.
